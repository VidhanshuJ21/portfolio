			"content": "The study found that the structural behavior of the vehicle was satisfactory, with maximum von Mises stress at spoke-hub junctions below the yield limit of structural steel. The design of lighter spoke shapes with curvature showed better flexibility while maintaining load-bearing capability. The terramechanics insights showed improved vertical stability with wider rims and lower spoke count, enabling better traction and sinkage resistance. Future designs should incorporate real-time soil feedback for adaptive performance.",
