			"title": "Design Methodology",
			"content": "The 3D model was created in Onshape to simulate modular fuel storage integration, using cold gas thrusters for their simplicity, safety, and lightweight design. The model was optimized for center of mass and structural integrity. Reliability modeling was performed using non-parametric failure data and belief-based expert surveys. Probabilistic models were applied to predict infant mortality rate, Mean Time To Failure, and propulsion subsystem reliability. The proposed design methodology allows functional builds for under $5,000, using Commercial Off-The-Shelf components and open-source design tools. The shell-integrated fuel tank passed FEA simulations with acceptable von Mises stress and deformation limits, with thrust benefits outweighing structural compromise. Mixed Weibull models provided the best fit for real-world CubeSat failures, with predicted early-life failure rates dropping by 23%. The Cold Gas Thruster subsystem achieved reliability.",
