	"title": "Design of a Wing-Integrated Propulsion System",
	"intro": "The main wing was designed using the NACA 66-212 airfoil, a laminar flow airfoil with a high lift-to-drag ratio, 12% maximum thickness, and good stall characteristics for medium-speed flight. It accommodates embedded nacelles and provides structural support. The propeller configuration consists of four symmetrical propellers with four blades each. The Clark Y airfoil is chosen for its flat lower surface, good lift characteristics, and proven use in small propeller and RC aircraft applications. The nacelle, designed to house brushless electric motors, ESCs, and actuators, is streamlined and faired into the wing to minimize interference drag.",
