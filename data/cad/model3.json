	"title": "Design and Finite Element Analysis of Leaf Spring",
	"intro": "Leaf springs are essential suspension components in automotive and heavy vehicle systems due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and load-bearing capabilities. Made from high-strength steel, they absorb shocks, maintain vehicle height, and transmit loads from the axle to the chassis. The materials used in this design are Gray Cast Iron, Glass Fibre Epoxy, and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer.",
