	"title": "Internal Structure of Aircraft Wing Design and its Finite Element Analysis",
	"intro": "The aircraft wing is a crucial load-bearing component in flight vehicles, ensuring structural integrity, stiffness, and weight efficiency. Balancing strength, weight, and manufacturability is essential in aerospace applications. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method evaluates wing performance under various loading scenarios. This study focuses on modeling, structural design, and FEA simulation of an aircraft wing's internal framework, aiming to identify stress concentrations, assess deformation characteristics, and validate the design's ability to withstand operational loads. The analysis supports lightweight yet robust wing structures that meet aerodynamic performance and structural safety standards.",
